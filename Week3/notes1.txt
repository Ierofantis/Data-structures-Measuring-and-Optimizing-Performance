1. Abstract Data Type (ADT) often manifest themselves as either interfaces or abstract class in Java. 但是, abstract
notion of list goes beyond a specific programming language. You can think of a grocery list of a list of students. These
things are not directly related to code. Therefore, this idea of abstract data type is broder than just a particular
implementation in a particular programming language. It is really just this abstract concept of how we interact with this
data. 

2. Describe the difference between an Abstract Data Type (ADT) and a Data Structure.

3. Implement Generic classes in Java. 泛型！！<E> or <T>具体看笔记。

4. Throw Exceptions to indicate errors. 异常处理, unchecked exception V.S. checked exception
对于checked exception, 我们需要在相应的方法处 declare throw exception.

5. 注意：Markov Text Generator产生的一些text从字面理解上并不make sense, 但是对于Markov Text是make sense的。

6. How can we increase confidence of our code?
	(1) Be critical of our algorithms/code 
	(2) Consider/test corner cases
	(3) Attempt to formally reason about correctness 
	(4) Create automated test cases

7. 	There are two testing styles. 
【1】	Black Box Testing (黑盒测试); Only tests through the interface, 给定输入只需要对比输出结果和理想输出结果是否一致。对于一些不熟悉内部implementation的人来说，测试会更容易些。
【2】   White Box Testing (白盒测试); Tests which know about the implementation.
	

8. Unit test is used to test small pieces of code or units of code. In Eclipse, JUnit allows us to write and run 
unit tests.
